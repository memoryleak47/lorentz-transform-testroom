# Whichever object you choose to follow (blue / violet), the other object should be shortened a lot across the X axis.
# Independent of the follow-object, blue and violet should move apart with the same speed.

# When following blue:
# - The green boxes should be non-deformed
# When following violet:
# - Each of the green boxes should be shortened in X (just like blue is), and
# - also the virtual box (whose 4 corners are the green boxes) should be shortened in X direction
